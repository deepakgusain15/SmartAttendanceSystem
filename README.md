# SmartAttendanceSystem
An AI-powered attendance system using Python and OpenCV to perform real-time Face Recognition, automatically logging attendance with timestamps into a database.

About the Project: This is an automated Face Recognition-based Attendance System developed using Python. It simplifies the attendance-marking process by recognizing registered faces in real-time through a webcam and logging their presence automatically.

Key Features:

Real-time Detection: Uses OpenCV to process live video feed and detect faces instantly.

High Accuracy: Powered by the face_recognition library to match captured faces with a pre-encoded database.

Automated Logging: Saves attendance data (Name and Timestamp) directly into a CSV file or database.

User Friendly: Eliminates manual errors and saves time for teachers and HR managers.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, Face-Recognition, NumPy, Pickle

IDE: VS Code / PyCharm
